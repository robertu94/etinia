magic =  Magic works using the difficulty system.  When a character uses a magic ability, they draw 2 cards.  The first card is the card bonus for the action. The second card determines whether or not the caster will suffer manna burn. This is determined by using the difficulty of the action.  If the rank of the second card is greater than or equal to the difficulty of the action, then the user suffers no manna burn; else, the user will suffer 1 damage as manna burn. Each level that a character has in a given skill reduces the difficulty of using abilities in that skill by their skill level. For example, a character with Cast 4 who is using an ability with a difficulty of 12 from the Cast skill would need a 8 or better to succeed. However if the same character attempted to use a Heal ability, He would have to get a Queen or better to succeed. Abilities that have enhanced manna burn will suffer the ceiling of ceiling (cost/5) damage.  For example the same mage casting the 12-difficulty spell except it dealt enhanced manna damage,the manna burn would be 3 damage.
