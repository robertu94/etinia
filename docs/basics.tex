\chapter{The Basics}
\section{What is Etinia?}
Etinia is a game engine. It is designed to be a tool set to facilitate a large
variety of different kinds of games including role playing games and tactical
combat games. This book contains the core rules for using this system, some
character samples, and the details of a world system designed to work with the
Etinia engine.
\section{A note on roleplaying}
The objective of a role playing game is to collaboratively tell a story between
the players. For some players, this is best accomplished with heavy rule sets
that clearly delineate skills so that each player is strictly balanced with
every other player. For others, this is best accomplished with light rule sets
that allow players to do wild and crazy things that are not at all balanced.
This rule set attempts to strike the best of both worlds by creating a modular
rule set. This means the tactical players have their strict rules set, but
role playing players may simply play without them. Unfortunately, one of these
styles requires much more precise language in order to achieve clarity.
Therefore, these rules will be written primarily to the audience of tactical
players. For those of you who prefer a lighter game, simply take the rules and
focus on what kind of abilities each level provides. For example, a Life mage
who can make a fireball could also light a candle with magic. The rules may
not clearly delineate this ability but it is obvious from the spirit of the
rules. This ambiguity then requires some sort of authority. Any ambiguity is
to be determined solely by the game master. Furthermore, these rules make
several clear references to distances, for a lighter game consider anything
with in 1 space to be close, 2 spaces to be mid ranged, and 3+ spaces to long
ranged. Therefore these distance rings could be used instead of a battle map.
Furthermore, for references to width assume that each weapon can hit the number
of enemies equal to the area in spaces of that it could hit on a battle map.
One final recommendation for role playing heavy groups would be for the game
master to assign a number of rp points to each player. These points could be
used to overrule a judgment call on a rule or to "re-roll" a failed attack or
test.

\section{How to get started}

\subsection{Hero}

The basis of Etinia is the hero\index{Hero}. Heroes can have skills.
Skills are organized into skill trees. Generally players for the RPG are
built to have 11 starting skill points and 5 skill slots. See the
Archetypes section for a more detailed explanation. Heroes have a certain
number of skill slots based on the players mind stat.

The skills\index{skills} that a Hero has determine which
Abilities\index{abilities} they may use. Abilities
are specific actions that a player may perform. For example a character with
Close Combat 1 gains the ability long cut which when equipped with a short range
weapon may target any hero in within two panels in front of him. In addition
having the necessary ability, Heroes must also choose to ready abilities. Readying
an ability is simply including the ability in a list of abilities that the hero will
use. Abilities may be readied at any time outside of combat. Each hero may
have up to 20 abilities readied. 
Heroes also have attributes\index{attributes}. The attributes in the game are Strength, Defense,
Speed, and Will. As attributes are advanced, the attributes that they represent
are improved. Strength affects how often actions the hero preforms succeed.
Defense affects how often actions preformed against the hero succeed. Speed
affects how often a hero gets to take an action. Will affects how many hits a
hero can take before being unable to fight.

Skills come in 5 skill levels with all having a
few additional special levels. Each level is more powerful than the last and
includes the abilities of every previous level. Level 1 skills are the weakest,
and level 5 skills are the most powerful. Over the course of the game, heroes
will level up. When Heroes level up, they may acquire new skills and improve
their current ones. For example, a hero would not have Close Combat 2 and Close
Combat 3 just Close Combat 3. All skills have a price in skill points based on
their level. 

\begin{center}
\rowcolors{1}{white}{gray}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X X}
\hline
Skill Level & Cost in Skill Points \\ \hline
1 & 1 \\
2 & 3 \\
3 & 6 \\
4 & 10 \\
5 & 15 \\
$\Omega$ & 1 \\
further & 0 \\
greater & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

For example, if a player wanted the skills Battle Knowledge 3 and Cast 2 (two
different skills); the player would need 9 skill points. Skills are organized
into Skill Trees based on function. Each character may have skills from upto 3
different skill trees without a specific item or skill that would indicate
otherwise.

There are a few special types of skill levels. When a player earns the level 5
skill, they have the opportunity to purchase the\index{omega skills} omega
skills. The omega skill is a more powerful skill than the level 5, but the
omega skill occupies an additional skill slot. 

There are also further\index{further knowledge} and greater\index{greater
knowledge} knowledge skills. The further knowledge skills affect skills in the
knowledge tree and are earned by acquiring the 3rd level of the respective
skill and having at least 3 skills from the knowledge tree. The greater skills
are imparted when the hero has 5 skills in the knowledge skill tree. The
further and greater skill levels do not occupy an additional skill slot. 


There are eight different skill trees: Attack, Defense, Knowledge, Magic,
Mechanics, Ancients, Drifting, and Material. 

Skills in the Attack\index{Attack } tree allow characters to deal damage to
opponents. These skills are handy for any damage dealing character or weapons
master character. Improving the skills allows you to increase the range, deal
more hits, and unlock more options. 

The Defense\index{Defense } tree allows player to reduce both directly and
indirectly the damage that they receive. These skills are useful for any wall
or tank character. As characters level up these skills, they will be able to
greater reduce the chance that they will take damage. 

The knowledge\index{Knowledge } tree is the house of all knowledge in the
game. The uses of the skills in the knowledge tree are as diverse as the
knowledge itself. Each skill contains a variety of different abilities that
become more and more potent as the character advances them. 

The Magic\index{Magic } tree is home to all things dealing with magic.
Characters based off mages, sages, and other magic casters will benefit greatly
from the skills in this tree. However with great power comes great cost. Many
skills in this tree require energy to be expended to be used. As the skills in
this tree are advanced, the abilities become more and more powerful. 

The Mechanics\index{Mechanics } tree is where robots programs and machines
take their power. However, with great power comes great cost. Many skills in
this tree can be prevented when damage is taken. As the skills in this tree are
advanced, the abilities become more and more powerful. 

The Ancients\index{Ancients } tree is home to old power. Heroes based off
colossal warriors can find their skills here. These skills give extreme power
for a limited time. As the skills in this tree are advanced, the abilities
become more and more powerful. 

The Drifting\index{Drifting } tree is home to portal users of all types.
Theses skills grant the ability to use portals for different actions. Heros of
various forms may find their power here. 

The Material\index{Material} tree is home to creating and using items. Crafters and warriors
alike with find useful skills here.
